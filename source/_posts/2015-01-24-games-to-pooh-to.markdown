To say I am a casual gamer is probably overstating my position, but I do like a bit of inflight entertainment during a "comfort break". This is a list of favourite games to play on the iPhone.

This is a new find for me and I love it. On first appearances, it's a Tetris clone. Actually though, that is not a fair assessment. The game's clever use of shades of colour and how they merge together, makes for an addictive game, that is harder than it looks! I think I've managed to get to level 9 so far.

Probably the best puzzle game I've ever played, certainly the most beautiful. The game plays on the complexity of Escher style architecture. I completed the game and the two expansions without too much difficulty, that shouldn't put you off though. It's a game that can replayed over and over and the experience is absorbing.

##[Osmos](itms://itunes.com/apps/osmos)
It's the longest standing (memorable) iOS game I have, actually on my iPad, but it is also available for iPhone. Also the first game that I installed that actively encourages the use of headphones to enhance the experience. I love Osmos; it's an incredibly relaxing game to play. The difficulty of levels varies greatly. I've not managed to complete the game so far, but I play it more out relaxation than out of a need to push through to the upper levels.
