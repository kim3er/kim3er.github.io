To say I am a casual gamer is probably overstating my position, but I do like a bit of inflight entertainment during a "comfort break". This is a list of favourite games to play on the iPhone.

This is a new find for me and I love it. On first appearances, it's a Tetris clone. Actually though, that is not a fair assessment. The game's clever use of shades of colour and how they merge together, makes for an addictive game, that is harder than it looks! I think I've managed to get to level 9 so far.
