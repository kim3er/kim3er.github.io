			<p>##TL;DR
&quot;Half-arsed&quot;, as in reducing possibility of getting a fat arse by working more efficiently.  It&#39;s a pun, I&#39;m funny like that.</p>
<p>##Introduction
I recently watched this video <a href="http://youtu.be/uiKg6JfS658">Are You Sitting Too Much?</a> and the followup <a href="http://youtu.be/4K_ENbRgywY">9 Tips To Save Your Life</a>. Please watch them if you sit for long periods of time, they&#39;re not long and you learn a lot.</p>
<p>I really had no idea, which is irritating because it makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense, because even in my ignorance, I have already seen the benefits yielded from breaking up my work. Having unwittingly lost half a stone this year, without changing my diet (next year&#39;s resolution).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The tips in the second video are insightful, but didn&#39;t really speak to my specific situation. So, I&#39;ve come up with a few ideas for how I might tackle the issue. </p>
<p>##Use a Timer
We use a service called <a href="https://letsfreckle.com/">Freckle</a> to track the time we spend on projects. On the Mac app at least, the timer beeps once an hour; this I believe is there to indicate that the timer is still running. It seems to me though, that it is also a great reminder to get up and stretch your legs for five minutes.</p>
<p>Now, while I adore Freckle and it&#39;s beautiful reporting, it is quite expensive. $49 per month for a team of five. I strive for greater efficiency, if only so one day I feel I can survive the week without Freckle. It is certainly too much to spend on a simple timer to remind you to get up and have a wander.</p>
<p>If I was without Freckle and facing this issue, I&#39;d recognise my personal cycles of work differ at different times during the day. That is to say, that I would be much aggrieved if I was interrupted from my work after a mere hour, first thing in the morning, but would take such a distraction as a blessing mid-afternoon. Instead, I&#39;d chop my day into sprints of different lengths, and set up timers accordingly. This would have the extra benefit of adding a bit more structure to my day, by understanding when I&#39;m more effective at longer or shorter tasks.</p>
<p>##Work Standing
I&#39;ve long enjoyed the idea of these adjustable desks, that allow you to work seated or standing. They are very expensive though and I wonder how I would actually get on coding for long periods of time, while standing.</p>
<p>Coding aside, I think a lot of activities can benefit from standing.</p>
<p>###Catch Up Meetings
The most obvious example is meetings. Quick catch up meetings have more impact when standing, the same meeting while seated would take twice as long.</p>
<p>###Phone calls
I&#39;m a pacer on the phone, so this is an easy one for me. It can be quite distracting for others, but I&#39;ll get most of my steps throughout the day just by talking on the phone.</p>
<p>###Poor man&#39;s adjustable desk
This is crazy idea I&#39;ve had, that I think I&#39;d like to trial. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d code standing up, but there is a bunch of other stuff that I would do on a computer while standing. Clearing up email, project management, or testing comes to mind.</p>
<p>The premise of my idea is that my development work requires a beast of a machine, but other tasks may not. I&#39;d have two desks, or at least have access to a second.</p>
<p>####Desk One
Desk One, as it has always been, comfy with massive computer in front of me. </p>
<p>####Desk Two
More like a shelf or a &quot;hot desking&quot; coffee shop table at standing height, with an inexpensive laptop (like a Chromebook) setup.</p>
<p>Every time you want to perform an admin task, you get up and walk to your admin shelf. It really doesn&#39;t need to be much more than that, if you&#39;re going to start leaning, you&#39;re using the space for the wrong task.</p>
<p>##Conclusion
I&#39;m really excited about setting up sprints. I like that I&#39;d be able communicate clearer expectations of when I&#39;m approachable to my co-workers, after understanding my own process more clearly.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also falling in love with the idea of an admin shelf, or maybe not an admin shelf, maybe an area that is more communal. A standing desk area, that by virtue of standing there says, &quot;Hey I&#39;m approachable&quot;. </p>
<p>##Conclusion on Conclusion
What&#39;s weird about my conclusion, is that it doesn&#39;t talk about my ideas in context of standing more; which is the point of the post. I seem to be more concerned with disruptions in my workflow and being approachable to my co-workers. I think that&#39;s interesting, because for me, it&#39;s all interconnected.</p>
<p>By playing with these techniques, I don&#39;t just prevent the onset of having a fat arse, I also become more productive and collaborative in my work.</p>
