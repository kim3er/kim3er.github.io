    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is never enough time. Last year in particular, it always felt like there wasn&rsquo;t enough time in the day.  Running a company, where your work is also the primary source of income, is no easy task. I was always looking for ways of squeezing more hours out of day; tweaking processes, finding better tools, writing scripts. It&rsquo;s become a bit of an obsession for me, finding &ldquo;better&rdquo; ways to get more stuff done. I was pretty good at it, I think I still am. But as the end of last year drew in, it became clear that I was spreading myself too thin.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I was a manager, a sales person, a support desk, a developer, and was switching these hats constantly throughout the day. My goal on any given day, was to get to the end of the day without any major mishaps. If I managed to progress at all, in terms of significant progression of a project or a more efficient way of doing something, well that was amazing.</p>

<p>The problem was concentration, I couldn&rsquo;t stay focused on a single task, without being distracted by someone or something craving my attention. We experimented with a few different ways of tackling this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Switching off access to email at specific parts of the day.</li>
<li>We decided that I should not answer the phone.</li>
<li>Further than this, I wouldn&rsquo;t participate in a phone call unless it was me that initiated it. If someone wanted to talk to me, a time would be arranged for me to ring them back.</li>
<li>Allocated time to perform specific tasks.</li>
</ol>


<p>These feel obvious to me now, but they weren&rsquo;t back then and had a huge impact on my ability to get through work. Even combined though, these were not the silver bullets I was after. I&rsquo;m too nosey for one thing, if someone else picked up the phone, my ears would prick up, brain on overdrive wondering what they wanted and were the requirements being dealt with correctly. And who can blame me, it&rsquo;s my company after all.</p>

<p>I needed a way of maintaining concentration, without completely removing myself from the office. My salvation came in another, now startlingly obvious, epiphany; headphones. It&rsquo;d never really occurred to me in the past to try headphones, because in the past I&rsquo;ve typically opted for in-ear earphones, which are uncomfortable over long periods of time. I&rsquo;m also pretty negative on headphones in an office environment as rule, because I hate sound leakage. But I didn&rsquo;t see that I had an option and it&rsquo;s made the world of difference. <a href="http://rich.k3r.me/blog/2015/01/20/finding-a-pair-of-headphones/">My earphones</a> use noise reduction to completely immerse me in the task at hand.</p>

<p>An unexpected and corny side effect of the headphones has been trust. I am nosey because I believe I need to be involved in every decision, that my opinion always needs to be considered. Switching on the headphones has demonstrated to me that  I&rsquo;m not (always) the centre of the universe, and that many facets of the company can run without my constant interference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m okay with that, because I spend a lot more time on the stuff I like doing now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Half-arsed&rdquo;, as in reducing possibility of getting a fat arse by working more efficiently.  It&rsquo;s a pun, I&rsquo;m funny like that.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I recently watched this video <a href="http://youtu.be/uiKg6JfS658">Are You Sitting Too Much?</a> and the followup <a href="http://youtu.be/4K_ENbRgywY">9 Tips To Save Your Life</a>. Please watch them if you sit for long periods of time, they&rsquo;re not long and you learn a lot.</p>

<p>I really had no idea, which is irritating because it makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense, because even in my ignorance, I have already seen the benefits yielded from breaking up my work. Having unwittingly lost half a stone this year, without changing my diet (next year&rsquo;s resolution).</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The tips in the second video are insightful, but didn&rsquo;t really speak to my specific situation. So, I&rsquo;ve come up with a few ideas for how I might tackle the issue.</p>

<h2>Use a Timer</h2>

<p>We use a service called <a href="https://letsfreckle.com/">Freckle</a> to track the time we spend on projects. On the Mac app at least, the timer beeps once an hour; this I believe is there to indicate that the timer is still running. It seems to me though, that it is also a great reminder to get up and stretch your legs for five minutes.</p>

<p>Now, while I adore Freckle and it&rsquo;s beautiful reporting, it is quite expensive. $49 per month for a team of five. I strive for greater efficiency, if only so one day I feel I can survive the week without Freckle. It is certainly too much to spend on a simple timer to remind you to get up and have a wander.</p>

<p>If I was without Freckle and facing this issue, I&rsquo;d recognise my personal cycles of work differ at different times during the day. That is to say, that I would be much aggrieved if I was interrupted from my work after a mere hour, first thing in the morning, but would take such a distraction as a blessing mid-afternoon. Instead, I&rsquo;d chop my day into sprints of different lengths, and set up timers accordingly. This would have the extra benefit of adding a bit more structure to my day, by understanding when I&rsquo;m more effective at longer or shorter tasks.</p>

<h2>Work Standing</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long enjoyed the idea of these adjustable desks, that allow you to work seated or standing. They are very expensive though and I wonder how I would actually get on coding for long periods of time, while standing.</p>

<p>Coding aside, I think a lot of activities can benefit from standing.</p>

<h3>Catch Up Meetings</h3>

<p>The most obvious example is meetings. Quick catch up meetings have more impact when standing, the same meeting while seated would take twice as long.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a pacer on the phone, so this is an easy one for me. It can be quite distracting for others, but I&rsquo;ll get most of my steps throughout the day just by talking on the phone.</p>

<h3>Poor man&rsquo;s adjustable desk</h3>

<p>This is crazy idea I&rsquo;ve had, that I think I&rsquo;d like to trial. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d code standing up, but there is a bunch of other stuff that I would do on a computer while standing. Clearing up email, project management, or testing comes to mind.</p>

<p>The premise of my idea is that my development work requires a beast of a machine, but other tasks may not. I&rsquo;d have two desks, or at least have access to a second.</p>

<h4>Desk One</h4>

<p>Desk One, as it has always been, comfy with massive computer in front of me.</p>

<h4>Desk Two</h4>

<p>More like a shelf or a &ldquo;hot desking&rdquo; coffee shop table at standing height, with an inexpensive laptop (like a Chromebook) setup.</p>

<p>Every time you want to perform an admin task, you get up and walk to your admin shelf. It really doesn&rsquo;t need to be much more than that, if you&rsquo;re going to start leaning, you&rsquo;re using the space for the wrong task.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about setting up sprints. I like that I&rsquo;d be able communicate clearer expectations of when I&rsquo;m approachable to my co-workers, after understanding my own process more clearly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also falling in love with the idea of an admin shelf, or maybe not an admin shelf, maybe an area that is more communal. A standing desk area, that by virtue of standing there says, &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m approachable&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Conclusion</h2>

<p>What&rsquo;s weird about my conclusion, is that it doesn&rsquo;t talk about my ideas in context of standing more; which is the point of the post. I seem to be more concerned with disruptions in my workflow and being approachable to my co-workers. I think that&rsquo;s interesting, because for me, it&rsquo;s all interconnected.</p>

<p>By playing with these techniques, I don&rsquo;t just prevent the onset of having a fat arse, I also become more productive and collaborative in my work.</p>
