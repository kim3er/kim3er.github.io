# Caching remote blobs in your hybrid app

"Offline first" apps is a big part of what we do at [Pathway](http://www.pathwaysoftware.com/); apps that typically rely on a web based CMS for content. These apps are primarily iOS & Android, but we have been dabbling with Windows (8.1 & Phone) & Chrome apps as well. One thing that invariably comes up in the architecture of these apps, is "how to store the binary assets?"

The way I see it, you have two options:

## IndexedDB

http://caniuse.com/#feat=indexeddb <-- Legacy support, other DBs aren't really up to the challenge.


## FileSystem
